Type 1 Diabetes	Diabetes mellitus characterized by insulin deficiency, sudden onset, severe hyperglycemia, rapid progression to ketoacidosis, and death unless treated with insulin. The disease may occur at any age, but is most common in childhood or adolescence.	T1D	#1f78b4	0
Multiple Sclerosis	A progressive autoimmune disorder affecting the central nervous system resulting in demyelination. Patients develop physical and cognitive impairments that correspond with the affected nerve fibers.	MS	#6a3d9a	0
Ankylosing Spondylitis	An autoimmune chronic inflammatory disorder characterized by inflammation in the vertebral joints of the spine and sacroiliac joints. It predominantly affects young males. Patients present with stiffness and pain in the spine.	AS	#cab2d6	0
Autoimmune Thyroid Disease	Inflammatory disease of the THYROID GLAND due to autoimmune responses leading to lymphocytic infiltration of the gland. It is characterized by the presence of circulating thyroid antigen-specific T-CELLS and thyroid AUTOANTIBODIES. The clinical signs can range from HYPOTHYROIDISM to THYROTOXICOSIS depending on the type of autoimmune thyroiditis.	ATD	#e31a1c	0
Celiac Disease	A digestive disease that is caused by an immune response to a protein called gluten, which is found in wheat, rye, barley, and oats. Celiac disease damages the lining of the small intestine and interferes with the absorption of nutrients from food. A person with celiac disease may become malnourished no matter how much food is consumed.	CEL	#33a02c	0
Crohn's Disease	A gastrointestinal disorder characterized by chronic inflammation involving all layers of the intestinal wall, noncaseating granulomas affecting the intestinal wall and regional lymph nodes, and transmural fibrosis. Crohn disease most commonly involves the terminal ileum; the colon is the second most common site of involvement.	CRO	#ff7f00	0
Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis	Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is a condition in which joint inflammation occurs in children under the age of 16 years. It lasts for at least six weeks.	JIA	#fdbf6f	0
Primary Biliary Cirrhosis	An autoimmune inflammatory disorder characterized by destruction of the small intrahepatic bile ducts. It affects predominantly females and it may lead to cirrhosis and liver failure. Patients have antimitochondrial and antinuclear antibodies in the peripheral blood.	PBC	#b2df8a	0
Psoriasis	A common genetically determined, chronic, inflammatory skin disease characterized by rounded erythematous, dry, scaling patches. Psoriatic lesions have a predilection for nails, scalp, genitalia, extensor surfaces, and the lumbosacral region; the pathology involves an accelerated epidermopoiesis. Psoriasis is associated with increased risk for melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and basal cell carcinoma.	PSO	#b15928	0
Rheumatoid Arthritis	A chronic systemic disease, primarily of the joints, marked by inflammatory changes in the synovial membranes and articular structures, widespread fibrinoid degeneration of the collagen fibers in mesenchymal tissues, and by atrophy and rarefaction of bony structures. Etiology is unknown, but autoimmune mechanisms have been implicated.	RA	#a6cee3	0
Systemic Lupus Erythematosus	A chronic, inflammatory, connective tissue disease that can affect many organs including the joints, skin, heart, lungs, kidneys, and nervous system. It is marked by many different symptoms; however, not everyone with SLE has all of the symptoms.	SLE	#ffd700	0
Ulcerative Colitis	An inflammatory bowel disease involving the mucosal surface of the large intestine and rectum. It may present with an acute or slow onset and follows an intermittent or continuous course. Signs and symptoms include abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, weight loss, and intestinal hemorrhage.

Sjogren Syndrome	An autoimmune disorder affecting the salivary and lacrimal glands. Morphologically, it is characterized by the presence of lymphocytic and plasmacytic infiltrates which cause destruction of these glands. It results in dry mouth and dry eyes. It may be associated with the presence of other autoimmune disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis and lupus erythematosus.	SJO	grey	1
Systemic Scleroderma	A chronic disorder, possibly autoimmune, marked by excessive production of collagen which results in hardening and thickening of body tissues. The two types of systemic scleroderma, limited cutaneous and diffuse cutaneous are classified with focus on the extent of affected skin. A relationship exists between the extent of skin area affected and degree of internal organ/system involvement. Systemic scleroderma can manifest itself in pulmonary fibrosis, Raynaud's syndrome, digestive system telangiectasias, renal hypertension and/or pulmonary hypertension.	SSC	grey	1
Vitiligo	A disorder consisting of areas of macular depigmentation, commonly on extensor aspects of extremities, on the face or neck, and in skin folds. Age of onset is often in young adulthood and the condition tends to progress gradually with lesions enlarging and extending until a quiescent state is reached.	VIT	grey	1
